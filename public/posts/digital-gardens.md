# On Digital Gardens

**Date:** November 2024

The internet arguably started as a collection of digital gardens—personal spaces curating knowledge, interests, and weird experiments. Then came the era of streams (social media), where content is ephemeral, algorithmic, and fleeting.

A digital garden is a rejection of the stream. It's a space that you tend to over time. It doesn't have to be polished. It can be a collection of notes, half-baked ideas, and things that simply bring you joy.

Why build one?
1. **Ownership**: You own your data and your platform.
2. **Learning**: Explaining things to yourself helps you learn.
3. **Connection**: Like-minded people find you through your interests, not your engagement hacks.

This website is my attempt at a garden. It starts with birds, but who knows what will grow here next.
