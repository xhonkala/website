# The Joy of Vanilla JS

**Date:** October 2024

Modern web development often feels like a Rube Goldberg machine. We have bundlers, transpilers, frameworks, meta-frameworks, and hydration strategies just to put some text on a screen.

There is a quiet joy in returning to the basics:
- **HTML** for structure.
- **CSS** for style.
- **JavaScript** for behavior.

That's it. No build step required (though I admit, I am using Vite here for convenience!).

## Performance
Vanilla JS is fast. It doesn't need to load a 100kb library before it starts running. It interacts directly with the DOM.

## Longevity
Ideally, code written in standard ES6 JavaScript today will still run in browsers 10 years from now. Can we say the same for code written in the latest flavor of the month framework?

Sometimes, less is more.
