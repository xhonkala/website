# About

Alexander Honkala is a computational biologist working at the intersection of manifold learning and the evolution of treatment resistance in cancer, chronic inflammation, and medical countermeasures. With a background spanning immunology research, entrepreneurship, drug development, Alexander focuses his manifold learning research on clinically-actionable outcomes, such as predicting drug perturbation responses and disease state evolutionary trajectories. His goals include finding ways to steer treatment resistance evolution, modeling cell-cell interactions fields with coupled manifolds, and getting a glimpse of the regulatory hyperobject lurking between scales of biological computation. In his free time, Alexander can be found cooking, making music, or out hiking. Usually friendly.
