# Datasets I Wish I Had

There are a surprisingly large number of situations in which we don't have much data at all, so I keep a running list of datasets I wish I had for things I'm curious about. Updated irregularly.

##### Human Health
+ Longitudinal datasets on all diseases with states that evolve over time: cancer, COPD, joint damage, NASH, etc *including treatment annotations*
+ Andropause
+ Salutogenic datasets: wound healing and stroke recovery trajectories
+ Spatial map of microbiome communities along length of intestine instead of descending colon snapshots
+ Mucosal barrier tissue-resident immune memory profiling to repeated exposure to similar antigens
+ Hematopoiesis alterations in clusters of co-morbid conditions
+ Autoantibody repertoires throughout life and correlates with changes in antigen expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells
+ Endocrine changes after deliberate induction of ketogenic or fasted states
+ Hypothalamal stem cell activity after hormetic insults, including exosome profiling
+ Exocrine cell type functional and regulatory profiling under various stressor conditions (e.g., goblet cells in GERD)
+ Limits on cell stress responses in various cell types: how close can they come to apoptotic shutdown but still recover? What signaling or metabolic substrates modify recoverability speed or penetrance?

##### Ecology
+ Lichen proteomics and epigenetic changes through dry to wet season transitions for variety of species
+ Mucin atlas and dehydration profiling
+ Hair follicle shifts when a dog blows its coat for the season
+ Mycelium contact tracing dyes
+ Moss stress responses to dehydration and sequence of rapid recovery on rehydration

##### Bioproduction
+ Longitudinal metabolic utilization in model organisms optimized for large scale production (K12 E. Coli, yeast, hybridomas)
+ Mucin atlas and dehydration profiling
+ Reverse genetics on IFNAR/CXCR/ILRs in cell therapy production donors
+ Stress resolution after electroporation or other transfection protocol
+ Missing technology: Golgi post-translational modification editing engineering
